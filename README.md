## To Check Out

## TODO:

- [x] `gf` should work with `require` and other items
- [x] Set `path` correctly for lua.
    - [ ] See if we can get `checkpath` to work.
        - It seems like it should, but not sure how to make that happen
        - I think this requires some understanding of `suffixesadd`
- [~] `K` should figure out if you're:
    - on a vim.fn style function
    - on a vim.api style function
    - on a vim.$something function
    - or on a lua built-in style function
    - Status:
        - It works when you write out the full names... but that doesn't seem super great
        - Kind of words when you type the whole name, but could have name clashes? Not clear.
- [ ] Add a `completion.nvim` source for currently available globals.
    - This won't be as good as something like sumneko, because that does actual analysis.
        But it could be good for finding all the things in `vim.api.*` etc.
- [ ] `include` should handle all the crazy ways you can make strings in lua.
- [ ] better text object support
    - Consider trying this out w/ tree sitter at some point...
- [ ] Add some "switch to test file" or other kind of thing
    - Could use projections, could use alternate.vim, ...?
- [ ] Set up for lua-formatter, cause that's really nice.
    - Check if sumneko can do lua formatting...
